        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p> HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</p>
        <ul> An element is a type of content on a webpage. The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages:
          <li>Text elements</li>
          <li> Image elements</li>
          <li>Header elements</li>
          <li>List elements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.
        </p>
        <ul>Here are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page:
          <li>Meta-related elements</li>
          <li>Content division elements</li>
          <li>Semantic elements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</p>
        <p>As developers, one of the first things we must think about when developing a webpage is building a sturdy "frame" using HTML. Letâ€™s start with our frame! When we create the structure for our webpage, we use a series of HTML elements to define the content and framework. These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets (< >). These tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.
        <ul> <p> Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the head and body elements. Take a moment to read the following descriptions of the head and body elements:</p>
          <li> The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
        </ul>
