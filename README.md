# AD-prework-study-gurd
This repo was done so I could restart the course on my one time. 
Started working again from the pre-work assignment, waling my way up. 
Step 1:
User story:
As a boot camp student, I want to set up the starter code for my project,
on my local computer so that I can work on the project using VS Code.
Acceptance criteria:
It is done when I have downloaded the starter code for the study guide project.
It is done when I have opened the project in VS Code.

Step 2:
User story:
As a developer, I want to understand the GitHub workflow so that I can keep my
local branch in sync with the remote repository.
Acceptance criteria:
It is done when I recognize the difference between a default branch and a feature branch.
It is done when I recognize the difference between base and comparison branches in pull requests.
It is done when I identify how pull requests and merging work in version control.

Git test feature is the 2nd commit. Switched to a new branch feature/starter-code
